# _Dr.Sillystringz's Factory_

#### By _Erin Timlin_

#### _A C# web application that Dr. Sillystringz can use to keep track of machine repairs. Here, they will be able to add engineer and machine details. They can add a machine to an engineer to keep track of which engineer is working on what machine._

## Technologies Used

* _.Net 6_
* _ASP.NET Core MVC 6_
* _C#_
* _MySQLWorkBench_
* _EF Core_
* _LINQ_

## Description

_As the factory manager, I need to be able to see a list of all engineers, and I need to be able to see a list of all machines._
_As the factory manager, I need to be able to select a engineer, see their details, and see a list of all machines that engineer is licensed to repair. I also need to be able to select a machine, see its details, and see a list of all engineers licensed to repair it._
_As the factory manager, I need to add new engineers to our system when they are hired. I also need to add new machines to our system when they are installed._
_I should not be able to create an engineer or a machine if the form's fields are empty or contain invalid values._
_As the factory manager, I should be able to add new machines even if no engineers are employed. I should also be able to add new engineers even if no machines are installed._
_As the factory manager, I need to be able to add or remove machines that a specific engineer is licensed to repair. I also need to be able to modify this relationship from the other side, and add or remove engineers from a specific machine._
_I should not be able to add a machine to an engineer if there are no machines. Likewise I should not be able to add an engineer to a machine if there are no engineers._
_When I access the application, I should see a splash page that lists all engineers and machines._
